Before you can do these exercises you will need 4 things. 1. Get the textbook. 2. Determine your level in the class. 3. Download the CIS213 github repository. 4. Create your java programming environment.

1. To get the book, download Java How To Program, by going to the [vitalsource books portal](https://cheyney.desire2learn.com/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=2498035&type=content&rcode=PASSHE-9805769) and clicking on the book on the right. The first time you click the book, you'll need to create account information for vitalsource. Please use your Cheyney email address to create your account to make it easy to remember.
1. To determine your level, use the following guidlines:
	1. If the highest programming class you've passed is CIS101, then you are in level 1.
	1. If the highest 200 level programming class you've passed is CIS102 or CIS215, then you are in level 2.
	1. If the highest 200 level programming class you've passed is CIS206, then you are in level 3.
1. To download the git repository, first create an account on github, then click [this link](https://classroom.github.com/a/T6nCTWe7) to have the repository copied to your account.
1. Your java programming environment is a personal choice. You can use an IDE (Integrated Development Environment), such as eclipse, NetBeans, or jGrasp. Or, you can use a combination of an editor (e.g. emacs, vim, notepad++, Atom, or Sublime text) and the command line tools.
