// My test plan was to just run it to see what the results were. It then made me choose the filling then used RNG to determ the color and cracked status 
// The only thing i can reall thing of to make it better was to add comments so that someone can understand what each part does like the one thast save your option i found that really help for the upcoming project 
// Saving your input and saving them throught the program is something I think im going to have trouble with later on
